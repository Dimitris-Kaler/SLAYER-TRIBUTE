        Slayer was formed in 1981 by Kerry King, Jeff Hanneman, Dave Lombardo, and Tom Araya in Huntington Park, CA. The
        group started out playing covers of songs by bands such as Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Venom at
        parties and clubs in Southern California.<br>
        The band's early image relied heavily on Satanic themes that featured pentagrams, make-up, spikes, and inverted
        crosses.
        Rumors that the band was originally known as Dragonslayer, after the 1981 film of the same name, were denied by
        King, as he later stated: "We never were; it's a myth to this day".<br>
        According to Lombardo, the original band name was to be Wings of Fire before they settled in with Slayer. It was
        he who designed the iconic logo. For inspiration, Lombardo thought in a perspective of a murderer of how they
        would carve out the logo with a knife and since he's lefthanded, the logo is unintentionally slanted to the
        right.

        Without any recording budget, the band had to self-finance its debut album. Combining the savings of Araya, who
        was employed as a respiratory therapist,[11] and money borrowed from King's father, the band entered the studio
        in
        November 1983. The album was rushed into release, stocking shelves three weeks after tracks were completed. Show
        No Mercy, released in December 1983 by Metal Blade Records, generated underground popularity for the band. The
        group began a club tour of California to promote the album. The tour gave the band additional popularity and
        sales
        of Show No Mercy eventually reached more than 20,000 in the US and another 20,000 worldwide.
        In February 1984, King briefly joined Dave Mustaine's new band Megadeth.Hanneman was worried about King's
        decision, stating in an interview, "I guess we're gonna get a new guitar player." While Mustaine wanted King to
        stay on a permanent basis, King left after five shows, stating Mustaine's band was "taking too much of my
        time."The split caused a rift between King and Mustaine, which evolved into a long running feud between the two
        bands.
        In June 1984, Slayer released a three-track EP called Haunting the Chapel. The EP featured a darker, more
        thrash-oriented style than Show No Mercy, and laid the groundwork for the future direction of the band. The
        opening track, "Chemical Warfare", has become a live staple, played at nearly every show since 1984.<br>
        Later that year, Slayer began their first national club tour, traveling in Araya's Camaro towing a U-Haul
        trailer.The band recorded the live album Live Undead in November 1984 while in New York City.

        Following the success of Hell Awaits, Slayer was offered a recording contract with Russell Simmons and Rick
        Rubin's newly founded Def Jam Records, a largely hip hop-based label. The band accepted, and with an experienced
        producer and major label recording budget, the band underwent a sonic makeover for their third album Reign in
        Blood.
        Def Jam's distributor, Columbia Records, refused to release the album due to the song "Angel of Death" which
        detailed Holocaust concentration camps and the human experiments conducted by Nazi Josef Mengele. The
        album was distributed by Geffen Records on October 7, 1986. However, due to the controversy, Reign in Blood did
        not appear on Geffen Records' release schedule. Although the album received virtually no radio airplay, it
        became the band's first to enter the Billboard 200, debuting at number 94, and the band's first album certified gold in
        the United States.
        Slayer embarked on the Reign in Pain world tour,but
        just one month into it, drummer Lombardo left the band. To continue with the tour,
        Slayer enlisted Tony Scaglione of Whiplash. However, Lombardo was convinced by his wife to return in 1987.
        In late 1987, Slayer returned to the studio to record their fourth studio album. To contrast the speed of Reign
        in
        Blood, the band consciously decided to slow down the tempos, and incorporate more melodic singing.
        Released in July 1988, South of Heaven received mixed responses from both fans and critics, although it was
        Slayer's most commercially successful release at the time, debuting at number 57 on the Billboard 200, and
        their second album to receive gold certification in the United States.

        Slayer returned to the studio in early 1990 with co-producer Andy Wallace to record its fifth studio album.
        Following the backlash created by South of Heaven, Slayer returned to the "pounding speed of Reign in Blood,
        while retaining their newfound melodic sense." Seasons in the Abyss, released on October 9, 1990, was the
        first Slayer album to be released under Rubin's new Def American label, as he had parted ways with Def Jam owner
        Russell Simmons over creative differences. The album debuted at number 44 on the Billboard 200, and was
        certified gold in 1992. The album spawned Slayer's first music video for the album's title track, which was
        filmed in front of the Giza pyramids in Egypt.
        Slayer returned as a live act in September 1990 to co-headline the European Clash of the Titans tour with
        Megadeth, Suicidal Tendencies, and Testament. During the sold out European leg of this tour, tickets had prices
        skyrocket to 1,000 Deutschmark (US$680) on the black market. With the popularity of American thrash at its peak,
        the band toured with Testament again in early 1991 and triple-headlined the North American version of the Clash
        of the Titans tour that summer with Megadeth, Anthrax, and opening act Alice in Chains. The band released a
        double live album, Decade of Aggression in 1991, to celebrate ten years since their formation. The compilation
        debuted at number 55 on the Billboard 200.
        In May 1992, Lombardo left the band due to conflicts with the other members, as well as his desire to be off
        tour for the birth of his first child.Lombardo formed his own band Grip Inc., with Voodoocult guitarist Waldemar
        Sorychta, and Slayer recruited former Forbidden drummer Paul Bostaph to fill in the drummer position. Slayer
        made its debut appearance with Bostaph at the 1992 Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington. Bostaph's
        first studio effort was a medley of three Exploited songs, "War", "UK '82", and "Disorder", with rapper Ice-T,
        for the Judgment Night movie soundtrack in 1993.

        In 1994, Slayer released Divine Intervention, the band's first album with Bostaph on the drums. The album
        featured songs about Reinhard Heydrich, an architect of the Holocaust, and Jeffrey Dahmer, an American serial
        killer and sex offender. Other themes included murder, the evils of church, and the lengths to which
        governments went to wield power, Araya's interest in serial killers inspired much of the content of the
        lyrics.
        Slayer geared up for a world tour in 1995, with openers Biohazard and Machine Head. A video of concert
        footage, Live Intrusion was released, featuring a joint cover of Venom's "Witching Hour" with Machine Head.
        Following the tour, Slayer was billed third at the 1995 Monsters of Rock festival, headlined by Metallica.
        In 1996, Undisputed Attitude, an album of punk covers, was released. The band covered songs by Minor Threat,
        T.S.O.L., Dirty Rotten Imbeciles, D.I., Verbal Abuse, Dr. Know, and The Stooges. The album featured three
        original tracks, "Gemini", "Can't Stand You", "Ddamm"; the latter two were written by Hanneman in 1984–1985
        for a side project entitled Pap Smear. Bostaph left Slayer shortly after the album's recording to work on his
        own project, Truth About Seafood. With Bostaph's departure, Slayer recruited Testament drummer Jon Dette, and
        headlined the 1996 Ozzfest alongside Ozzy Osbourne, Danzig, Biohazard, Sepultura, and Fear Factory. Dette was
        fired after a year, due to a fallout with band members. After that, Bostaph returned to continue the tour.
        Diabolus in Musica was released in 1998, and debuted at number 31 on the
        Billboard 200, selling over 46,000 copies in its first week. 
        The album was the band's first to primarily feature dropped tuning, as featured on the lead track, "Bitter
        Peace", making use of the tritone interval referred to in the Middle Ages as the Devil's interval.

        After delays regarding remixing and artwork, including slip covers created to cover the original artwork as
        it was deemed "too graphic", Slayer's next album, God Hates Us All, was released on September 11, 2001. The
        band received its first Grammy nomination for the lead track "Disciple", although the Grammy was awarded to
        Tool, for "Schism".
        The September 11 attacks on America jeopardized the 2001 European tour Tattoo the Planet originally set to
        feature Pantera, Static-X, Cradle of Filth, Biohazard and Vision of Disorder. The dates in the United
        Kingdom were postponed due to flight restrictions, with a majority of bands deciding to withdraw, leaving
        Slayer and Cradle of Filth remaining for the European leg of the tour.
        Pantera, Static-X, Vision of Disorder and Biohazard were replaced by other bands depending on location;
        Amorphis, In Flames, Moonspell, Children of Bodom, and Necrodeath. Biohazard eventually decided to rejoin
        the tour later on, and booked new gigs in the countries, where they missed a few dates. Drummer Bostaph left
        Slayer before Christmas in 2001, due to a chronic elbow injury, which would hinder his ability to play.
        Since the band's European tour was unfinished at that time, the band's manager, Rick Sales, contacted
        original drummer Dave Lombardo and asked if he would like to finish the remainder of the tour.Lombardo
        accepted the offer, and stayed as a permanent member.
        Slayer toured playing Reign in Blood in its entirety throughout the fall of 2003, under the tour banner
        "Still Reigning". Their playing of the final song, "Raining Blood", culminated with the band drenched in a
        rain of stage blood. Live footage of this was recorded at the Augusta Civic Center in Augusta, Maine, on
        July 11, 2004 and released on the 2004 DVD Still Reigning. The band also released War at the Warfield and a
        box set, Soundtrack to the Apocalypse featuring rarities, live CD and DVD performances and various Slayer
        merchandise.

        The next studio album, Christ Illusio would be the first album with original drummer Lombardo since 1990's Seasons in the Abyss.
        Slayer released Eternal Pyre on June 6 as a limited-edition EP.
         Eternal Pyre featured the song "Cult", a live performance of "War Ensemble" in Germany and video footage of the band recording "Cult".
        On June 30, Nuclear Blast Records released a 7" vinyl picture disc version limited to a thousand copies.
        Christ Illusion was eventually released on August 8, 2006, and debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200, selling over 62,000 copies in its first week. 
        The album became Slayer's highest charting, improving on its previous highest charting album, Divine Intervention, which had debuted at number 8.
        Three weeks after the album's release, Slayer were inducted into the Kerrang! Hall of Fame for their influence to the heavy metal scene.
        The video for the album's first single, "Eyes of the Insane", was released on October 30, 2006. The track was featured on the Saw III soundtrack, and won a Grammy-award for "Best Metal Performance" at the 49th Grammy Awards..
        The band's eleventh studio album, World Painted Blood, was released by American Recordings. It was available on November 3 in North America and November 2 for the rest of the world. The band stated that the album takes elements of all their previous works including Seasons in the Abyss, South of Heaven, and Reign in Blood.
        In early 2011, Hanneman was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis. According to the band, doctors said that it likely originated from a spider bite.
        Jeff ended up contracting a bacteria that ate away his flesh on his arm, so they cut open his arm, from his wrist to his shoulder. The band decided to play their upcoming tour dates without Hanneman.
         Gary Holt of Exodus was announced as Hanneman's temporary replacement

        On May 2, 2013, Hanneman died due to liver failure in a local hospital near his home in Southern
        California's Inland Empire; the cause of death was later determined to be alcohol-related
        cirrhosis. King confirmed that the band would continue, saying "Jeff is going to be in everybody's
        thoughts for a long time. It's unfortunate you can't keep unfortunate things from happening. But we're
        going to carry on – and he'll be there in spirit." However, Araya felt more uncertain about the band's
        future, expressing his belief that "After 30 years [with Hanneman active in the band], it would
        literally be like starting over", and doubting that Slayer's fanbase would approve such a change.
        Despite the uncertainty regarding the band's future, Slayer still worked on a followup to World Painted
        Blood. Additionally, it was reported that the new album would still feature material written by
        Hanneman.
        At the 2014 Revolver's Golden Gods Awards ceremony, Slayer debuted "Implode", its first new song in five
        years. Repentless, the
        band's twelfth studio album, was released on September 11, 2015. Slayer toured for two-and-a-half years
        in support of Repentless. 
        On January 22, 2018, Slayer announced their farewell world tour through a video featuring a montage of
        press clippings, early posters and press photos spanning the band's entire career. Although the members
        of Slayer have never publicly explained why they were retiring.
