      Slayer was formed in 1981 by Kerry King, Jeff Hanneman, Dave Lombardo, and Tom Araya in Huntington Park, CA. The
      group started out playing covers of songs by bands such as Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Venom at
      parties and clubs in Southern California.<br>
      The band's early image relied heavily on Satanic themes that featured pentagrams, make-up, spikes, and inverted
      crosses.
      Rumors that the band was originally known as Dragonslayer, after the 1981 film of the same name, were denied by
      King, as he later stated: "We never were; it's a myth to this day".<br>
      According to Lombardo, the original band name was to be Wings of Fire before they settled in with Slayer. It was
      he who designed the iconic logo. For inspiration, Lombardo thought in a perspective of a murderer of how they
      would carve out the logo with a knife and since he's lefthanded, the logo is unintentionally slanted to the right.

      Without any recording budget, the band had to self-finance its debut album. Combining the savings of Araya, who
      was employed as a respiratory therapist,[11] and money borrowed from King's father, the band entered the studio in
      November 1983. The album was rushed into release, stocking shelves three weeks after tracks were completed. Show
      No Mercy, released in December 1983 by Metal Blade Records, generated underground popularity for the band. The
      group began a club tour of California to promote the album. The tour gave the band additional popularity and sales
      of Show No Mercy eventually reached more than 20,000 in the US and another 20,000 worldwide.
      In February 1984, King briefly joined Dave Mustaine's new band Megadeth.Hanneman was worried about King's
      decision, stating in an interview, "I guess we're gonna get a new guitar player." While Mustaine wanted King to
      stay on a permanent basis, King left after five shows, stating Mustaine's band was "taking too much of my
      time."The split caused a rift between King and Mustaine, which evolved into a long running feud between the two
      bands.
      In June 1984, Slayer released a three-track EP called Haunting the Chapel. The EP featured a darker, more
      thrash-oriented style than Show No Mercy, and laid the groundwork for the future direction of the band. The
      opening track, "Chemical Warfare", has become a live staple, played at nearly every show since 1984.<br>
      Later that year, Slayer began their first national club tour, traveling in Araya's Camaro towing a U-Haul
      trailer.The band recorded the live album Live Undead in November 1984 while in New York City.

      Following the success of Hell Awaits, Slayer was offered a recording contract with Russell Simmons and Rick
      Rubin's newly founded Def Jam Records, a largely hip hop-based label. The band accepted, and with an experienced
      producer and major label recording budget, the band underwent a sonic makeover for their third album Reign in
      Blood, resulting in shorter, faster songs with clearer production. The complex arrangements and long songs
      featured on Hell Awaits were ditched in favor of stripped down, hardcore punk influenced song structures.
      Def Jam's distributor, Columbia Records, refused to release the album due to the song "Angel of Death" which
      detailed Holocaust concentration camps and the human experiments conducted by Nazi physician Josef Mengele. The
      album was distributed by Geffen Records on October 7, 1986. However, due to the controversy, Reign in Blood did
      not appear on Geffen Records' release schedule. Although the album received virtually no radio airplay, it became
      the band's first to enter the Billboard 200, debuting at number 94, and the band's first album certified gold in
      the United States.
      Slayer embarked on the Reign in Pain world tour, with Overkill in the US from October to December 1986, and Malice
      in Europe in April and May 1987. They also played with other bands such as Agnostic Front, Testament, Metal
      Church, D.R.I., Dark Angel and Flotsam and Jetsam.The band was added as the opening act on W.A.S.P.'s US tour, but
      just one month into it, drummer Lombardo left the band: "I wasn't making any money. I figured if we were gonna be
      doing this professionally, on a major label, I wanted my rent and utilities paid." To continue with the tour,
      Slayer enlisted Tony Scaglione of Whiplash. However, Lombardo was convinced by his wife to return in 1987.
      At the insistence of Rubin, Slayer recorded a cover version of Iron Butterfly's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" for the film
      Less Than Zero. Although the band was not happy with the final product, Hanneman deeming it "a poor representation
      of Slayer" and King labeling it "a hunk of shit", it was one of their first songs to garner radio airplay.
      In late 1987, Slayer returned to the studio to record their fourth studio album. To contrast the speed of Reign in
      Blood, the band consciously decided to slow down the tempos, and incorporate more melodic singing. According to
      Hanneman, "We knew we couldn't top Reign in Blood, so we had to slow down. We knew whatever we did was gonna be
      compared to that album, and I remember we actually discussed slowing down. It was weird—we've never done that on
      an album, before or since."
      Released in July 1988, South of Heaven received mixed responses from both fans and critics, although it was
      Slayer's most commercially successful release at the time, debuting at number 57 on the Billboard 200,[20] and
      their second album to receive gold certification in the United States.[21] Press response to the album was mixed,
      with AllMusic citing the album as "disturbing and powerful",[23] and Kim Nelly of Rolling Stone calling it
      "genuinely offensive satanic drivel". King said "that album was my most lackluster performance", although Araya
      called it a "late bloomer" which eventually grew on people.[12] Slayer toured from August 1988 to January 1989 to
      promote South of Heaven, supporting Judas Priest in the US on their Ram It Down tour, and touring Europe with
      Nuclear Assault and the US with Motörhead and Overkill.

      Slayer returned to the studio in early 1990 with co-producer Andy Wallace to record its fifth studio album.
      Following the backlash created by South of Heaven, Slayer returned to the "pounding speed of Reign in Blood,
      while retaining their newfound melodic sense."[25] Seasons in the Abyss, released on October 9, 1990, was the
      first Slayer album to be released under Rubin's new Def American label, as he had parted ways with Def Jam owner
      Russell Simmons over creative differences. The album debuted at number 44 on the Billboard 200,[20] and was
      certified gold in 1992.[21] The album spawned Slayer's first music video for the album's title track, which was
      filmed in front of the Giza pyramids in Egypt.
      Slayer returned as a live act in September 1990 to co-headline the European Clash of the Titans tour with
      Megadeth, Suicidal Tendencies, and Testament. During the sold out European leg of this tour, tickets had prices
      skyrocket to 1,000 Deutschmark (US$680) on the black market. With the popularity of American thrash at its peak,
      the band toured with Testament again in early 1991 and triple-headlined the North American version of the Clash
      of the Titans tour that summer with Megadeth, Anthrax, and opening act Alice in Chains.[17] The band released a
      double live album, Decade of Aggression in 1991, to celebrate ten years since their formation. The compilation
      debuted at number 55 on the Billboard 200.
      In May 1992, Lombardo left the band due to conflicts with the other members, as well as his desire to be off
      tour for the birth of his first child.Lombardo formed his own band Grip Inc., with Voodoocult guitarist Waldemar
      Sorychta,[28] and Slayer recruited former Forbidden drummer Paul Bostaph to fill in the drummer position. Slayer
      made its debut appearance with Bostaph at the 1992 Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington. Bostaph's
      first studio effort was a medley of three Exploited songs, "War", "UK '82", and "Disorder", with rapper Ice-T,
      for the Judgment Night movie soundtrack in 1993.

      In 1994, Slayer released Divine Intervention, the band's first album with Bostaph on the drums. The album
      featured songs about Reinhard Heydrich, an architect of the Holocaust, and Jeffrey Dahmer, an American serial
      killer and sex offender. Other themes included murder, the evils of church, and the lengths to which
      governments went to wield power, Araya's interest in serial killers inspired much of the content of the
      lyrics.
      Slayer geared up for a world tour in 1995, with openers Biohazard and Machine Head. A video of concert
      footage, Live Intrusion was released, featuring a joint cover of Venom's "Witching Hour" with Machine Head.
      Following the tour, Slayer was billed third at the 1995 Monsters of Rock festival, headlined by Metallica.
      In 1996, Undisputed Attitude, an album of punk covers, was released. The band covered songs by Minor Threat,
      T.S.O.L., Dirty Rotten Imbeciles, D.I., Verbal Abuse, Dr. Know, and The Stooges. The album featured three
      original tracks, "Gemini", "Can't Stand You", "Ddamm"; the latter two were written by Hanneman in 1984–1985
      for a side project entitled Pap Smear. Bostaph left Slayer shortly after the album's recording to work on his
      own project, Truth About Seafood. With Bostaph's departure, Slayer recruited Testament drummer Jon Dette, and
      headlined the 1996 Ozzfest alongside Ozzy Osbourne, Danzig, Biohazard, Sepultura, and Fear Factory. Dette was
      fired after a year, due to a fallout with band members. After that, Bostaph returned to continue the tour.
      Diabolus in Musica (Latin for "The Devil in Music") was released in 1998, and debuted at number 31 on the
      Billboard 200, selling over 46,000 copies in its first week. The album received a mixed critical reception,
      and was criticized for adopting characteristics of nu metal music such as tuned down guitars, murky chord
      structures, and churning beats. Blabbermouth.net reviewer Borijov Krgin described the album as "a feeble
      attempt at incorporating updated elements into the group's sound, the presence of which elevated the band's
      efforts somewhat and offered hope that Slayer could refrain from endlessly rehashing their previous material
      for their future output",[33] while Ben Ratliff of The New York Times had similar sentiments, writing on June
      22, 1998 that: "Eight of the 11 songs on Diabolus in Musica, a few of which were played at the show, are in
      the same gray key, and the band's rhythmic ideas have a wearying sameness too."
      The album was the band's first to primarily feature dropped tuning, as featured on the lead track, "Bitter
      Peace", making use of the tritone interval referred to in the Middle Ages as the Devil's interval. Slayer
      teamed up with digital hardcore group Atari Teenage Riot to record a song for the Spawn soundtrack titled "No
      Remorse (I Wanna Die)". The band paid tribute to Black Sabbath by recording a cover of "Hand of Doom" for the
      second of two tribute albums, titled Nativity in Black II. A world tour followed to support the new album,
      with Slayer making an appearance at the United Kingdom Ozzfest 1998.

      After delays regarding remixing and artwork, including slip covers created to cover the original artwork as
      it was deemed "too graphic", Slayer's next album, God Hates Us All, was released on September 11, 2001. The
      band received its first Grammy nomination for the lead track "Disciple", although the Grammy was awarded to
      Tool, for "Schism".
      The September 11 attacks on America jeopardized the 2001 European tour Tattoo the Planet originally set to
      feature Pantera, Static-X, Cradle of Filth, Biohazard and Vision of Disorder. The dates in the United
      Kingdom were postponed due to flight restrictions, with a majority of bands deciding to withdraw, leaving
      Slayer and Cradle of Filth remaining for the European leg of the tour.
      Pantera, Static-X, Vision of Disorder and Biohazard were replaced by other bands depending on location;
      Amorphis, In Flames, Moonspell, Children of Bodom, and Necrodeath. Biohazard eventually decided to rejoin
      the tour later on, and booked new gigs in the countries, where they missed a few dates. Drummer Bostaph left
      Slayer before Christmas in 2001, due to a chronic elbow injury, which would hinder his ability to play.[38]
      Since the band's European tour was unfinished at that time, the band's manager, Rick Sales, contacted
      original drummer Dave Lombardo and asked if he would like to finish the remainder of the tour.Lombardo
      accepted the offer, and stayed as a permanent member.
      Slayer toured playing Reign in Blood in its entirety throughout the fall of 2003, under the tour banner
      "Still Reigning". Their playing of the final song, "Raining Blood", culminated with the band drenched in a
      rain of stage blood. Live footage of this was recorded at the Augusta Civic Center in Augusta, Maine, on
      July 11, 2004 and released on the 2004 DVD Still Reigning. The band also released War at the Warfield and a
      box set, Soundtrack to the Apocalypse featuring rarities, live CD and DVD performances and various Slayer
      merchandise. From 2002 to 2004, the band performed over 250 tour dates, headlining major music festivals
      including H82k2, Summer tour, Ozzfest 2004 and a European tour with Slipknot. While preparing for the
      Download Festival in England, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich was taken to a hospital with an unknown and
      mysterious illness, and was unable to perform. Metallica vocalist James Hetfield searched for volunteers at
      the last minute to replace Ulrich;
      Lombardo and Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison volunteered, with Lombardo performing the songs "Battery" and
      "The Four Horsemen".

      On May 2, 2013, Hanneman died due to liver failure in a local hospital near his home in Southern
      California's Inland Empire;[88][89] the cause of death was later determined to be alcohol-related
      cirrhosis.[90] King confirmed that the band would continue, saying "Jeff is going to be in everybody's
      thoughts for a long time. It's unfortunate you can't keep unfortunate things from happening. But we're
      going to carry on – and he'll be there in spirit." However, Araya felt more uncertain about the band's
      future, expressing his belief that "After 30 years [with Hanneman active in the band], it would
      literally be like starting over", and doubting that Slayer's fanbase would approve such a change.
      Despite the uncertainty regarding the band's future, Slayer still worked on a followup to World Painted
      Blood. Additionally, it was reported that the new album would still feature material written by
      Hanneman.
      At the 2014 Revolver's Golden Gods Awards ceremony, Slayer debuted "Implode", its first new song in five
      years. The group announced that they had signed with Nuclear Blast, and planned to release a new album
      in 2015.[94] It was reported that Holt would take over Hanneman's guitar duties full-time,[95] although
      Holt did not participate in the songwriting.[96] In February, Slayer announced a seventeen date American
      tour to start in June featuring Suicidal Tendencies and Exodus.
      In 2015, Slayer headlined the Rockstar Energy Mayhem Festival for the second time. Repentless, the
      band's twelfth studio album, was released on September 11, 2015. Slayer toured for two-and-a-half years
      in support of Repentless. The band toured Europe with Anthrax and Kvelertak in October and November
      2015, and embarked on three North American tours: one with Testament and Carcass in February and March
      2016, then with Anthrax and Death Angel in September and October 2016,[102] and with Lamb of God and
      Behemoth in July and August 2017.
      A lone date in Southeast Asia in 2017 was held in the Philippines.

      On January 22, 2018, Slayer announced their farewell world tour through a video featuring a montage of
      press clippings, early posters and press photos spanning the band's entire career. Although the members
      of Slayer have never publicly explained why they were retiring from touring, it was thought that one of
      the reasons behind this decision was at the expense of Tom Araya's desire not to tour anymore and to
      spend more time with his family. This was confirmed by former drummer Dave Lombardo in a 2019 interview,
      who said: "Apparently, from what I hear. Tom has been wanting to retire when I was in the band — he
      wanted to stop. He had the neck issues. He's been wanting to retire for a long time now. So now that
      he's got it, I'm happy for him, and I hope he gets what he wants out of life and his future."
      The farewell tour began with a North American trek in May and June 2018, supported by Lamb of God,
      Anthrax, Behemoth and Testament. The second leg of the North American tour took place in July and
      August, with Napalm Death replacing Behemoth, followed in November and December by a European tour with
      Lamb of God, Anthrax and Obituary.The farewell tour continued into 2019, with plans to visit places such
      as South America, Australia and Japan; in addition to European festivals such as Hellfest and
      Graspop,[116][117] the band toured the United States in May 2019 with Lamb of God, Amon Amarth and
      Cannibal Corpse. Slayer also played one show in Mexico at Force Fest in October 2018.
      On December 2, 2018, Holt announced that he would not perform the remainder of the band's European tour
      to be with his dying father. Vio-lence and former Machine Head guitarist Phil Demmel would fill in for
      him as a result.
      Holt had stated that Slayer would not release a new album before the end of the farewell tour. On how
      long the tour would last, Holt's Exodus bandmate Steve "Zetro" Souza commented, "I'm speculating it's
      gonna take a year and a half or two years to do the one final thing, but I believe it's finished.
      Everybody knows what I know; just because I'm on the outside, I have no insight on that." The final
      North American leg of the tour, dubbed "The Last Campaign", took place in November 2019, and also
      included support from Primus, Ministry and Philip H. Anselmo & The Illegals. Despite being referred to
      as a farewell tour for Slayer, their manager Rick Sales has stated that the band is not breaking up, but
      has no intention of ever performing live again. Kristen Mulderig, who works with Rick Sales
      Entertainment Group, has also been quoted as saying that there would be Slayer-related activities
      following the tour's conclusion. However, within two days after the tour's completion, King's wife
      Ayesha stated on her Instagram page that there is "not a chance in hell" that Slayer would ever reunite
      to perform more shows or release new music.
